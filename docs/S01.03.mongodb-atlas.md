# Guided practice on MongoDB Atlas

In this document

- we work on MongoDB Atlas a hosted service of MongoDB
- create a database, load some docs and do a few queries
- then move on to working with python or the terminal and a more complex database

At the end of this session you should start to have a good grasp on MongoDB querying language.

Goals:

- You can connect to a MongoDB Atlas server
- You can create a database and insert documents
- You can build somewhat complex queries over a MongoDB database

## Many ways to work with MongoDB

On your local machine

- MongoDB Community Edition = Self-hosted, runs on your computer
- MongoDB Compass - the GUI tool for visualization
- `mongosh` the CLI in the terminal

You can also work with your favorite scripting language : python, node.js, go, ruby, PHP, Java, etc ...

Today we work on the hosted version Atlas.

[MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/lp/cloud/atlas/try4-reg) provides Cloud-hosted service with both free and paid tiers.

Atlas gives us a hosted cluster on which we can create a database, import some sample collections and understand how to do CRUD operations in MongoDB. You do not need to install anything.

> **CRUD** stands for Create, Read, Update, and Delete : the four basic operations for a DBMS

## Atlas

Let's start by creating an account on Atlas <https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas/register>

Then:

- Create a cluster and a project (I called my project `Sandbox`)

![Create a cluster](./../img/create_new_cluster.png)

### Important

- **Copy your database password**. It's best to set it as an environment variable or in a `.env` file (for python).

- Check that your **IP** is added to the list, visit `Network Access` (left navigation)
  - allow access from any IP using 0.0.0.0/0 (not recommended for production).

![add IP address](./../img/atlas_add_ip_address.png)

### Then

- Go to clusters
- Create a database: add name `songsdb` and collection name `songs`,
- Insert a Document

```json
{
  "_id":{
    "$oid":"6745ab6f0e0bbdab062667c7"
    },
    "title": "Happy",
    "artist": "Pharrell Williams",
    "year": 2013,
    "mood": "joyful"
}
```

![insert a document](./../img/atlas_insert_document.png)

And insert another one

```json
  "title": "Highway to hell",
  "artist": "AC/DC",
  "year": 1981,
  "mood": "energetic"
```

So we have 2 documents !

Let's explore !!! This is exciting ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ðŸ¤£ !

## Querying in MongoDB

In MongoDB querying comes down to writing JSON


| json                           | query                     |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------- |
| `{}`                           | returns all the documents |
| `{ field : value  }`           | where field = value       |
| `{ field : { $lt : value }  }` | where field <= value      |

So if we want to find all the documents in our songs collection, simply write '{}' in the query field

This returns our 2 songs.

![{} returns the whole dataset](./../img/query_musicdb.png)

And the query `{ year: { $lt: 2000 } }` returns the song that was released before 2000.

![{ year : {$lt : 2000} } returns the whole dataset](./../img/query_musicdb_year.png)

## Moaaar dataaaa!

This is all nice but we need more data to play with.

Let's import the ATLAS sample datasets.

Goto `Clusters > dots > load sample dataset`

![load sample dataset](./../img/atlas_load_sample_dataset.png)

Then click on your project name (for me Sandbox ) and `Browse collections` to view the available databases

You get a new database `movies_mflix` with 5 collections.

![Atlas sample databases](./../img/sample_datasetsets_atlas.png)

Look at the `embedded_movies` collection that has 1525 documents and notice the structure of a document

A document is a JSON record.

It can have:

- **nested JSON** : check out the nested dictionaries `imdb` and the `tomatoes` fields.
- **arrays**: check out genres, cast, languages, writers, ...

The primary key of a collection is always "`_id`".

```json
{
    "_id": {
        "$oid": "573a1390f29313caabcd5293"
    },

        }
    }
}
```

The ATLAS UI is great but I'd rather work with code than a UI.

Let's switch to python or `mongosh` to explore that movies database and learn how to query in MongoDB.

## Connect via your language

Atlas allows you to connect to your cluster

![connect to your cluster](./../img/connect_to_cluster.png)

### Connect In Python

We need the [pymongo](https://pypi.org/project/pymongo/) package

```bash
pip install pymongo
```

The connection string is

```python
connection_string = "mongodb+srv://alexis:<db_password>@skatai.w932a.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority&appName=SkatAI"
```

Note: it's best to put the connection string as an environment variable (`$MONGO_ATLAS_URI`), for instance in a `.env` file. then load it with

```python
import os
from dotenv import load_dotenv

load_dotenv()

MONGO_ATLAS_URI = os.getenv('MONGO_ATLAS_URI')
```

And then

```python
from pymongo import MongoClient

client = MongoClient(MONGO_ATLAS_URI)
```

Once we have a client we can connect to the database

```python
db = client["sample_mflix"]
```

and instantiate a collection object

```python
collection = db["movies"]
```

The collection object is of the class `pymongo.synchronous.collection.Collection` and has many methods:

![many collections methods](./../img/collection_many_methods.png)

### Use the terminal with `mongosh`

How to install `mongosh`:  <https://www.mongodb.com/docs/mongodb-shell/install/>

python: the quotes

```python
db.movies.find(
    {"runtime": {"$gt" : 180}},  // Filter on movie duration
    { "_id": 0, "title": 1, "runtime": 1, "imdb.rating": 1 }  // Projection to include title and imdb.rating, exclude _id
)
```

`mongosh`: no quotes

```json
db.movies.find(
    {runtime: {$gt : 180}},  // Filter on movie duration
    { _id: 0, title: 1, runtime: 1, "imdb.rating": 1 }  // Projection to include title and imdb.rating, exclude _id
)
```



### Filtering

<https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/reference/glossary/>

The JSON that specifies the filtering arguments is called a **query predicate**. It is an expression that returns a boolean indicating whether a document matches the specified query.

For example, `{ title: { $eq: "Dil Se" } }`, which returns documents that have a field "title" whose value is the string "Dil Se".

An empty query predicate (`{ }`), the query returns all documents in the collection.

Main functions on a collections

| function              | returns                                                                                 |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `find()`              | all the documents                                                                       |
| `find_one()`          | the 1st document                                                                        |
| `distinct("<field>")` | list of distinct values for the `<field>`                                               |
| `count_documents({})` | number of documents for the collection or returned by the filter in the query predicate |

Note also

- `find_one_and_replace()`
- `find_one_and_update()`
and

- `delete_many()`
- `delete_one()`
- `drop_index()`


Note: You can also just query the collection directly from the client with `db.<collection_name>.find()`

```bash
collection.find({})
# or
db.movies.find({})
```

You can chain these methods with limit and sort

```bash
db.movies.find(   {runtime: {$gt: 120}}   ).limit(3)
```

### Cursor

The returned result is a **cursor**.

```python
cursor = db.movies.find({})
```

A cursor is a pointer over a MongoDB query set of results.

### Projection

In database speak, **projecting** means selecting a subset of all the fields.

In SQL, you simply list the column names

```sql
select genres, plot from movies;
```

In MongoDB, specify in a json object which field you want to see right after the query predicate

```json
db.movies.find(
    {runtime: {$gt : 180}},  // Filter on movie duration
    { _id: 0, title: 1, runtime: 1, "imdb.rating": 1 }  // Projection to include title and imdb.rating, exclude _id
)
```

Projection:  `({ _id: 0, title: 1, runtime: 1, "imdb.rating": 1 })`

- `title: 1`: Includes the title field.
- `runtime: 1,` includes the runtime
- `"imdb.rating": 1`: Includes the `imdb.rating` field.
- `_id: 0`: Excludes the `_id` field from the result (default is 1 if not specified).

The query returns

```json
  { runtime: 240, title: 'Napoleon', imdb: { rating: 7.4 } },
  { runtime: 281, title: 'Les MisÃ¨rables', imdb: { rating: 7.9 } },
  { runtime: 245, title: 'Flash Gordon', imdb: { rating: 7.3 } },
  { runtime: 238, title: 'Gone with the Wind', imdb: { rating: 8.2 } },
```

### Exercises

Let's run a few queries in python on the movies database

```python
import os
from pymongo import MongoClient

connection_string = os.getenv('MONGO_ATLAS_URI')
client = MongoClient(connection_string)
db = client["sample_mflix"]
```

Then

- Retrieve all movies that have the genre "Action". Only get the title and genres.

```python
cursor = db.movies.find(
    {"genres": "Action"},  # Filter: movies with 'Action' in the genres array
    {"_id": 0, "title": 1, "genres": 1}  # Projection: include title and genres, exclude _id
)
```

to see the results

```python
for movie in cursor:
    print(movie)
```

with `mongosh`:

```python
cursor = db.movies.find(
    {"genres": "Action"},  # Filter: movies with 'Action' in the genres array
    {"_id": 0, "title": 1, "genres": 1}  # Projection: include title and genres, exclude _id
)
```


### Number of documents

Fastest way is to use `count_documents`

```python
count = db.movies.count_documents({"imdb.rating": {"$gt": 8.0}})
```

> Note: in python you can clone the cursor to get it's length and the number of returned documents.
> Cloning the cursor does not consume it

```python
len(list(cursor.clone()))
```

### Your turn

with

```python
cursor = db.movies.find( filter, projection).limit(5)
for movie in cursor:
    print(movie)
```

Write the filter and projection for the following queries and return also the number of documents with `db.movies.count_documents(filter)`

- use projection to only return relevant fields or at minimum "title"
- limit the results to 5 documents


1. Find Movies with an IMDb Rating Greater Than 8
   - filter: `{"imdb.rating": {"$gt" : 8}}`
   - projection : `{"_id": 0, "title": 1, "imdb.rating": 1}`
2. Movies Released After 2000
3. Movies with Specific Directors: "Christopher Nolan". Show the title, director and year
4. Retrieve movies with a `tomatoes.viewer.rating > 4.0`, showing the title and viewer rating.
5. Find movies that contain `"Comedy"` and `"Drama"` in the `genres` array. use `{$all: [list of genres]}`
6. Combine Query with Sorting: Retrieve the top 5 movies with the highest IMDb rating, showing title and rating. (you need to only retrieve `imdb.rating` with data type `double`)
7. Query Movies with a Range of Years: Retrieve movies released between 1990 and 2000, showing the title and year.
8. Query Movies with Missing Fields: Find movies where the `fullplot` field does not exist. use `$exists`.
9. find all the distinct genres
   - use `db.movies.distinct("genres")`
10. movies with at least 2 genres
    - use `{"genres": {$size: 2}}`
11. Movies with genre Action,after 1950 with imdb ratings > 8, sort by year desc, imdb rating desc
    - use `{
      "year": {$gt: 1950},
      "imdb.rating": {$gt: 8},
      "genres": "Action"
    }`
12. Movies with both genres : Action and Drama
    - `$and: [
        {"genres": "Action"},
        {"genres": "Drama"}
    ]`
13. Movies with either Action or Drama
    - `$or: [
        {"genres": "Action"},
        {"genres": "Drama"}
    ]`
14. Movies after 1950 with either imdb.rating > 0 or awards.wins > 5
    - use : `{
    "year": {$gt: 1950},
    $or: [
        {"imdb.rating": {$gt: 8}},
        {"awards.wins": {$gt: 5}}
    ]
}`

etc etc

## conclusion

In this session, you have learned:

- An overview of the different types of databases
- relational vs non relation database
- flexible schema in NoSQL databases

- Why and when to choose MongoDB over SQL
-

And you practiced:

- Seeting up MongoDB Atlas, a cloud-hosted database service, including cluster creation and security configuration

- Writing basic MongoDB queries using JSON format:
  - Basic syntax: `{}` for all documents, `{field: value}` for equality, `{field: {$lt: value}}` for comparisons
  - How to query nested fields and arrays in complex documents

- Connecting to MongoDB Atlas using Python and `pymongo`:
  - Using basic operations: `find()`, `find_one()`, `distinct()`, `count_documents()`
